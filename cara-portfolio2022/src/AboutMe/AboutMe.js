            <p>I made a huge leap in 2018, attending a coding bootcamp in Seattle, WA. My journey has taken me from a Teaching Assistant, Intern all the way to a Full Stack Web Developer. Since making the career change, I've been building a passion for Web Accessibility, and I hope to work with mission based organizations on collaborating and creating accessible and innovative products that help improve lives and the world we live in. Please take a look at some of my professional and personal projects.</p>
